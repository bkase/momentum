# Reflection

**Goal:** Implement CLI tool integration for API calls

**Duration:** 25 minutes

## What happened during the session?

I worked on replacing the direct HTTP API calls in the Rust CLI with subprocess calls to the claude CLI tool. I successfully updated the RealApiClient implementation to use tokio::process::Command to execute `zsh -c "claude -p '...'"` commands. The implementation includes proper error handling for missing tools and a 90-second timeout.

## What went well?

- The existing ApiClient trait abstraction made it easy to swap implementations
- The claude CLI returns clean JSON when asked, which simplified parsing
- Tests were already well-structured and didn't need major changes

## What could be improved?

I got a bit distracted checking the claude CLI response time and testing different prompts. Should have focused more on the core implementation first.

## Key learnings

- Using `zsh -c` ensures the user's shell configuration is loaded
- The claude CLI tool takes about 3-4 seconds to respond
- Integration tests should be marked with #[ignore] when they depend on external tools
