# Make the ui consistent
**Status:** Refining
**Agent PID:** 86469

## Original Todo
This means for the ActiveSessionView, AnalysisResultView, and AwaitingAnalysisView be consistent with the design in PreparationView -- as part of this task we should refactor the styling in PreparationView into a brand asset catalog. Please generate a brand reference using the fonts and colors that are currently in PreparationView as the ground-truth but for anything missing refer to @docs/brand.md .
