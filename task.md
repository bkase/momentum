# Integrate with aethel and my vault

**Status:** Refining
**Agent PID:** 28825

## Original Todo

The momentum rust application should rely on aethel for its document management. So the whatever JSON state should be serialized in the Markdown YAML front matter. And if there's other Markdown files and all of the outputs of the focus sessions should be managed, created, stored in the aethel vault instead. You can learn about the aethel protocol in ../../aethel/docs/protocol.md , please use the ../../aethel/crates/aethel-cli to manage the aethel integration. We can depend on the crate from our local filesystem for now since aethel is still in active development.
