# Don't use the API calls but use the cli tools
**Status:** Refining
**Agent PID:** 3112

## Original Todo
Don't use the API calls but use the cli tools `claude -p` and `gemini -p` instead

These are installed in different ways per user, but `zsg -c "gemini -p '<query>'"` should do the trick because it will load from the user's `.zshrc`
